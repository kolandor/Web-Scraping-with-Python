# A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
# RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

# Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions
# Import the re module:
import re



def show_re(regexPattern):
    # try
    with open("RegEx/regex training.txt", "rt") as file:
        textFileData = file.read()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    show_re()
